I plan on exploring the relation between countrie's investment into AI and thier state of economic freedom. I wonder if the recent emergence of AI is influeced by a countries history of economic prosperity. As we've learned in this course, human labor is a controversal backbone behind AI training, I think it would be useful to look at the economic state of the countries who are heavily invested in AI technology to determine how thier wealth and job market factors into AI. In addition, I am particially interested in how a countries respect for intellectual property rights correlates with a countries commitment to artifical intelligence from a govermental strategy POV. I hope that this exploration will help me understand why certain countries are prioritizing AI more than others and how this relates to citizen economic life.
