### Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between economic factors and global investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) across the globe. Using two datasets—AI Global Impact and the Economic Freedom Index—we explore three key research questions: (1) **Does high investment in AI technologies correlate with a stronger or weaker economic freedom score across global countries?** (2) **How have national unemployment rates influenced efforts to create AI-related jobs and develop AI-driven solutions?** (3) **Does a government's respect for intellectual property influence thier efforts in AI research?** By merging and analyzing data, we identify trends and correlations through visualizations such as scatter plots, regression lines, and bar graphs. Findings suggest moderate correlations between economic freedom and AI investment, as well as between intellectual property respect and AI research funding. Additionally, countries with lower unemployment rates often demonstrate higher AI talent scores, highlighting potential economic conditions conducive to AI development. Limitations include dataset time gaps, potential confounding variables, and a restricted sample size, indicating the need for further research to draw more definitive conclusions. 

1. **Does high investment in AI technologies correlate with a stronger or weaker economic freedom score across global countries?**
2. **How have national unemployment rates influenced efforts to create AI-related jobs and develop AI-driven solutions?**
3. **Does a government's respect for intellectual property influence thier efforts in AI research?**

### Datasets 
**AI Global Impact (2022)**:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katerynameleshenko/ai-index) 

The data was collected from open sources: [https://www.tortoisemedia.com/intelligence/global-ai/], [https://www.worldbank.org/en/home], [https://ourworldindata.org/]. This dataset is published by Kateryna Meleshenko who made most recent updates to the dataset in 2022. The publisher indicates that all 7 indicator values in the datset were calculated by Tortoise Media via weighting and summarizing 143 other indicators.

**The Economic Freedom Index (2019)**:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lewisduncan93/the-economic-freedom-index)

This dataset belongs to The Heritage Foundation: [https://www.heritage.org/index.] There was no licenses listed for this data on The Heritage Foundation. I researched the foundation's website and learned that the Economic Freedom Index is derived from university scholars all over the world, primarly professors in economics and psychology. 

There seems to be right-leaning political skew over this organization, as stated in organization's preface, "Despite conservative wins beating back bad liberal policies on the state level, the progressive agenda in Washington continues to severely undercut the economic freedom of Americans." [https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/report#indexHumanFlourishing]. This could pose skewed perspectives on how the US economy performs in comparison to other countries around the world.
