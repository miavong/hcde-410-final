I plan on exploring the relation between countrie's investment into AI and how it realtes to thier economic freedom. The motivation behind this research proposal stems from the recent emergence of AI, and I hope to find correlations between AI investment and the  countries history of economic prosperity. As we've learned in this course, human labor is a controversal backbone behind AI training, I think it would be interesting to look at the economic state of the countries who are heavily invested in AI technology to determine how thier wealth and job market factors into AI investment. In addition, I am particially interested in how a countries who rank high in respect for intellectual property correlates with a countries commitment to artifical intelligence from a governmental POV. I hope that this exploration will help me understand why certain countries are prioritizing AI more than others and how this relates to overall economic strategy.
