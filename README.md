### Preface
I plan on exploring the relation between countrie's investment into AI and how it realtes to thier economic freedom. The motivation behind this research proposal stems from the recent emergence of AI, and I hope to find correlations between AI investment and the  countries history of economic prosperity. As we've learned in this course, human labor is a controversal backbone behind AI training, I think it would be interesting to look at the economic state of the countries who are heavily invested in AI technology to determine how thier wealth and job market factors into AI investment. In addition, I am particially interested in how a countries who rank high in respect for intellectual property correlates with a countries commitment to artifical intelligence from a governmental POV. I hope that this exploration will help me understand why certain countries are prioritizing AI more than others and how this relates to overall economic strategy. 

### Datasets 

**AI Global Impact (2022)**:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katerynameleshenko/ai-index) 

The data was collected from open sources: [https://www.tortoisemedia.com/intelligence/global-ai/], [https://www.worldbank.org/en/home], [https://ourworldindata.org/]. This dataset is published by Kateryna Meleshenko who made most recent updates to the dataset in 2022. The publisher indicates that all 7 indicator values in the datset were calculated by Tortoise Media via weighting and summarizing 143 other indicators.

**The Economic Freedom Index (2019)**:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lewisduncan93/the-economic-freedom-index)

This dataset belongs to The Heritage Foundation: [https://www.heritage.org/index.] There was no licenses listed for this data on The Heritage Foundation. I researched the foundation's website and learned that the Economic Freedom Index is derived from university scholars all over the world, primarly professors in economics and psychology. 

There seems to be right-leaning political skew over this organization, as stated in organization's preface, "Despite conservative wins beating back bad liberal policies on the state level, the progressive agenda in Washington continues to severely undercut the economic freedom of Americans." [https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/report#indexHumanFlourishing]. This could pose skewed perspectives on how the US economy performs in comparison to other countries around the world.
